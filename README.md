# HyGAnno
HyGAnno is an automated cell type annotation method designed to improve the annotation quality of single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) data. HyGAnno transfers cell type information from well-annotated scRNA-seq references to unlabeled scATAC-seq targets, 
by utilizing inherent information derived from the original peaks of the data. HyGAnno provides not only cell type annotations but also a reference-target cell graph to assist in identifying ambiguous cells, thereby enhancing the reliability of the cell annotations. HyGAnno stands out for its accuracy in cell annotation and its capacity for interpretable cell embedding, exhibiting robustness against noisy reference data and adaptability to tumor tissues.

HyGAnno is developed using PyTorch. The conda virtual environments recorded required packages are provided.
